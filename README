           Integrating Emacs built from source into Debian
           ===============================================

N.B.: If you use this package, you should purge it before upgrading your
distribution, because otherwise it is likely to break the upgrade process:
the emacs binary may well depend on library versions that are removed by the
upgrade, and hence the emacsen-common hooks will fail!

This git repository contains some useful resources for integrating
Emacs built from source into Debian or derivatives like Ubuntu.

There are two parts to this kit:

1. You should run debian-init.el early in your Emacs startup process
   (I load it immediately after setting up my load-path). It runs
   Debian’s Emacs init files.

2. restore-emacs should be run every time you update your Emacs
   installed from source (e.g. with git pull), from the top-level
   source directory. It “makes install” in the current directory,
   fixes some symlinks and installs emacs-snapshot_1.0_all.deb, a
   package which provides Emacs to satisfy the dependencies of other
   packages.

Also, see https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=840793

In emacsen-common 2.0.8 at least (possibly earlier), and until the bug is
fixed, /usr/lib/emacsen-common/packages/install/emacsen-common must be
patched to make installation work: lines 25-26, which read:

(cd /usr/share/${FLAVOR}/site-lisp
  ln -s ../../emacs/site-lisp/debian-startup.el .)

   should be replaced with:

ln -s /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/debian-startup.el /usr/share/${FLAVOR}/site-lisp/
